      <p>One day, we’ll be able to use this ad. This whole process—kicked off by an epically productive productivity break—was some of the most fun I’ve had here. Thanks for keeping the creative quirk strong. Congrats on the new gig, and hit me up when you’re settled in the Bay Area!—Melissa</p>
      <p>Who knew grilled lettuce could taste good?! Thanks for teaching me about design and food and for all the yummy eats. Will miss you, Sarah, RB and Walter but wishing you all the best on your new bougey Cali adventure :)—Rebecca</p>

      <p>Jordan! Make those robots neon and glitchy! All our random bus rides were the best. Hopefully your next one leads to a later last call.—Matthew</p>

      <p>Thank you for reintroducing me to the word rad. Haven’t used it so much since I was 12. It’s great. Also, I learned a lot making guacamole with you over the last few years. Keep it weird, my friend.—Paul</p>

      <p>I was trying to find the video of your cat trying to eat a taco tied to a balloon that we used for Firefox but couldn’t. This’ll have to do. Gonna miss you and all the weird things we convinced everyone we needed to make 💙—Liz</p>
      <p>You will be dearly missed!  My conversation with you at All Hands in Hawaii (3 weeks before I started this job) convinced me that all would be OK. Your creativity, good humor, and enthusiasm are inspiring!—Ashley</p>
